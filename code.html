    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Personal Career Goal</h2>
    <hr style="width:100px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
       My personal career goal would be wanting to be a good runner. 
       My plans for achieving this goal would be going out everyday with the time I have left and run at least for 60 mins because that will increase my speed and endurance. 
       This would be a good career choice because it can help me with my heart rate and learning how to save the energy when your running to the finish line.
       This carrer choice can also help me become happy in life because it's a hobby I enjoy.

       <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey"> Strength and Personal Qualities</h2>
       <p>
        The strength and personal qualities I posses related to my carrer goal which is running is persitent. 
        I am peristent in running by not giving up when I am tired because I know I have to get to the finish line and finish the race. 
        This has been shown in the past when I have taken a test because I do a lot of prepartion for the test since I am very peristent of what I am doing.
        If I show I am peristent in running I think I can make it to the Olympics because I am working up to my goal.  
       </p>
       <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Your Abilities and Work Skills/ Achievemnets</h2>
       One of my important achievements as being a runner would be being a Varsity Runner.
       That would be an important achievement for me because now that motivates me to do even better and keep up the good work.
       Another achievement for me would be getting 7th place in one of my races at Freedom High because it wasn't easy getting 7th place since there were a lot of people who were ahead of me and I had to pace myself to catch up to them.
       What I have learned from my experience of being a varsity runner in cross country is the amount of work that goes into it and staying consistent with your timing and pacing
       I think I have been doing that because my time's have been getting a lot faster since my first race.
